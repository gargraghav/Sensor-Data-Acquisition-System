Hi, my name is Raghav. This is my contribution being a part of TEAM ASTRAL that participated in the Annual CanSat Competition in the year 2016 and 2017 respectively. I have created a Sensor Data Acquisition System on MATLAB and LabView in the respective years fetching wireless sensor data from a space system payload at 1 hz rate. The payload is travelling in the atmosphere with the help of a sounding rocket.<br/>
<br/>
I served as the Team Lead and IT Head, managing a team of ten. I was responsible for the development and integration of Sensor Subsystems (using AVR MCU), Communication Systems (XBee Pro S2C) and Ground Control Station.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result</b>: We won the <b>first rank</b> all across the globe defeating top universities of US, Canada, Europe. The team was honoured in acclaimed journals and newspapers in India and overseas.

## Ground Station
The ground station features the data acquisition system (on the laptop) and an antenna which fetches the real-time data from the atmospheric payload in the air and plots the graphs. We have different unique components like 3D data mapping, Camera Control, GPS, heading directions, and Flight Software State on the developed system.
