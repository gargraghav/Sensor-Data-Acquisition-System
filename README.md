Hi, my name is Raghav. This is my contribution being a part of TEAM ASTRAL that participated in the Annual CanSat Competition in the year 2016 and 2017 respectively. I have created a Sensor Data Acquisition System on MATLAB and LabView in the respective years fetching wireless sensor data from a space system payload at 1 hz rate. The payload is travelling in the atmosphere with the help of a sounding rocket.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result</b>: We won the <b>first rank</b> all across the globe defeating top universities of US, Canada, Europe. The team was honoured in acclaimed journals and newspapers in India and overseas.
